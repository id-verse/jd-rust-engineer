# Rust 🦀 Developer @ OCR Labs

**Full time - Remote - Earth**

Join a growing team of passionate engineers and build a world-class platform to fight identity fraud at a global scale. In Rust 🦀.

## The Position

You will work in close collaboration with our Head of Architecture, our engineering team and our product team to:

- Write and re-write hardened, documented, and tested web- and api-based applications
- Create CLI tools with and for the DevOps team
- Define and enforce best practices in an expanding Rust team

A fair chunk is green-field work **(and no, it's not crypto-currency/blockchain related 😉)**.
We prefer event-based architectures, cloud (AWS) and serverless. Only the good stuff.

## Needed qualifications

Whilst technical competence is critical, we place great emphasis on passion, communication and collaboration across the business.

- You have a solid experience creating and maintaining web-based and api-based applications (in Rust or not) ;
- You can demonstrate having built non-trivial Rust projects, ideally web-related ;
- You are comfortable with Javascript/Typescript ;
- You are able to communicate clearly, both in writing and orally, and collaborate effectively with a remote team ;
- You understand that documentation is half the battle, and that untested code is broken code ;
- You know it takes time to build anything correctly, and you also know how to "get things done" when the situation calls for it ;
- You are autonomous, but also know it's better to ask than to guess. You are dependable, responsible, and committed.

## Nice-to-Haves

It would be even more awesome if you have experience:

- building **WebAssembly** applications (with Yew, maybe?) ;
- solving problems with **machine learning** ;
- developing for/with **AWS Serverless technologies** (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB...).
